> A lightweight, cross-platform C++ library and standalone media player designed to parse, decode, and play **UMD Video ISOs** — the missing link in PSP preservation.

The ultimate goal of this project is to achieve a stable, low-overhead playback layer for UMD Video content that can be seamlessly integrated into existing PSP emulators (such as **PPSSPP**) or used as an independent preservation tool.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Motivation

While PlayStation Portable (PSP) game emulation has reached near-perfection, native support for **UMD Video ISOs** remains largely unsupported or unstable across all major emulators.

UMD Video discs use a specific filesystem structure rooted in the `UMD_VIDEO/` directory, containing:
- **MPEG Program Stream (`.MPS`)** containers with **H.264 AVC or MPEG-2** video tracks (title-dependent)
- **ATRAC3plus**, **AC3**, or **LPCM** audio formats
- Interactive menu overlays built on **`.RCO` / `.VBO`** assets

**UMDVPlay** aims to bridge this gap by building a dedicated, efficient decoder from the ground up — in pure C++ with FFmpeg — heavily optimized to run even on low-spec legacy hardware.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | C++17 | Modern standard, no C++20 for max compiler compatibility |
| Decoder | FFmpeg (libavcodec / libavformat) | Linked as pre-compiled static libraries |
| Windowing & Events | SDL2 | Software renderer default; optional GPU backend for capable systems |
| Build System | CMake | Cross-platform, supports MinGW / MSVC / GCC / NDK |

### 🎯 Target Platforms

| Platform | Toolchain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 🪟 Windows | MinGW / MSVC | Primary target |
| 🐧 Linux | Native GCC | Primary target |
| 🤖 Android | Android NDK | Long-term — contributions welcome |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1** — ISO Parser: navigate `UMD_VIDEO/STREAM/`, extract raw `.MPS` bytes from the UDF filesystem
- [ ] **Phase 2** — FFmpeg Integration: demux and decode `.MPS` containers with strict A/V synchronization
- [ ] **Phase 3** — SDL2 GUI: standalone player with Play, Pause, Seek, and Volume controls
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Menu Research: reverse-engineer UMD interactive menus via `.RCO` / `.VBO` overlays
- [ ] **Phase 5** — PPSSPP API: expose a clean C-style API for upstream integration
